# CME 192: MATLAB for Scientific Computing and Engineering (Winter 2026)

Welcome to **CME 192**: an 8-lecture, application-driven short course designed to make you **fluent in MATLAB** and comfortable building **real scientific computing workflows** (not just toy exercises).

This repository is the central home for:
- **Lecture slides**
- **MATLAB Live Scripts (`.mlx`)**
- **Required datasets**
- **Assignment handouts + starter code**

## What you’ll learn

This course emphasizes **real-world applications** of applied & computational mathematics using **MATLAB’s ecosystem**.

Topics include:
1. Advanced plotting and 2D/3D visualization + interactive plotting  
2. Numerical linear algebra, ODEs/PDEs, symbolic math  
3. Big data and databases  
4. Python/C++ interfaces and workflows  
5. Statistics and machine learning  
6. Optimization and simulation/modeling  
7. Image processing and signal processing  
8. Parallel processing (multicore + GPU)

By the end of the course, you should be able to build complete workflows in a variety of domains using MATLAB:
**load -> clean -> visualize -> analyze/model -> interpret -> present results**.
