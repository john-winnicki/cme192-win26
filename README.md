# CME 192: MATLAB for Scientific Computing and Engineering (Winter 2026)

Welcome to **CME 192** — an 8-lecture, application-driven crash course designed to make you **fluent in MATLAB** and comfortable building **real scientific computing workflows** (not just toy exercises).

This repository is the central home for:
- **Lecture slides**
- **MATLAB Live Scripts (`.mlx`)**
- **Required datasets**
- **Assignment handouts / starter code**
- Any additional course resources needed to complete the coursework

## What This Course Is About

This course emphasizes **real-world applications** of applied & computational mathematics using **MATLAB’s ecosystem**. Each lecture is organized around practical tools and workflows used in engineering and scientific computing, including:
- visualization and interactive plotting
- numerical linear algebra and differential equations
- big data workflows
- Python/C++ interoperability
- statistics & machine learning
- optimization and simulation
- image & signal processing
- parallel computing (multicore + GPU)

By the end of the course, you should be able to build end-to-end workflows in MATLAB:
**load → clean → visualize → analyze/model → interpret → present results**.
